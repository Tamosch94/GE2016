Investigate how the vertice's coordinates relate to pixel positions within the output window.
- What are the smallest and largest x- and y-values for vertices that can be displayed within the output window?
	The smallest x- and y- value for vertices that can be displayed within the output window is -1.
	The largest x- and y- value for vertices that can be displayed within the output window is 1.
- What happens to your geometry if you re-size the output window? 
	Because of the Clip Plane the geometry gets scaled too.
- What happens if you change the z-values of your vertices (currently set to 0)?
	If the z-value is between -1 and 1 nothing will happen (i guess because the opbject is still inside the near and far clipping plane)
	If the z-value is bigger then 1 the specific part of the triangle gets cut out (object is outside of clipping plane)
- What happens if you change the order of the indices in the Triangles array? Try to explain your observation.
	If you just change the order of the indices output looks the same.
	If you change the order of the single vertex points an error occurs: the vertext doesnt get drawn
